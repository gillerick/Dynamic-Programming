# Definition
Dynamic programming is an algorithm technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down to its respective sub-problems. It utilizes the fact that the optimal solution to a larger problem depends upon the optimal solution of its subproblems.

# Examples included in the repo
1. Fibonacci numbers
2. Grid Traversal problem
3. Target Sum Problem
4. Array of Target Sum Problem
5. Best Sum Problem
